# ChaCha20 Encryption and Decryption

This project demonstrates the use of the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using Python and the `pycryptodome` library.

## Features

- Encrypts a plaintext message using a specified encryption key and nonce.
- Decrypts the encrypted message back to its original form.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library

## Installation

To install the required library, run:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
